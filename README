About SALOME Geometry
*********************

SALOME Geometry module implements the CAD modeling services:
- Import and export of geometrical models in IGES, BREP, STEP, STL, XAO and VTK formats;
- Construct geometrical objects using a wide range of functions;
- Display geometrical objects in the 3D viewer;
- Transform geometrical objects using various algorithms;
- Repair geometrical objects (shape healing);
- View information about geometrical objects using measurement tools;
- Design shapes from pictures.

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version/>

* Pre-requisites page at SALOME web site:

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/license/>

Note: SALOME Geometry module needs SALOME KERNEL and SALOME GUI as
pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir GEOM_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd GEOM_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME Geometry
      module (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME Geometry sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME Geometry
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME Geometry module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME Geometry module supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help
