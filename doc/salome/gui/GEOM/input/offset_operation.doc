\n To produce an <b>Offset Surface</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Offset Surface</b>

\n This operation translates each point of an \b Object (a set of
Objects) along a local normal by a given \b Offset distance (signed
number, negative value meaning inner offset). Gaps between translated 
adjacent surfaces are filled in either of two ways: 
- if <b>Join by pipes</b> is activated, they are filled with pipes;
- else the surfaces are extended and intersected, so that sharp edges
  are preserved.

\n \b Offset operation is applicable to faces, shells and solids.

\n <b>Example:</b>

\image html offsetsn.png "The box and its offset surface (Join by pipes activated)"

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> 
- Gaps filled by pipes: <em>geompy.MakeOffset(Shape, Offset),</em>
- Gaps filled by intersection: <em>geompy.MakeOffsetIntersectionJoin(Shape, Offset),</em>

where Shape is a shape(s) which has to be an offset, Offset is a value of
the offset.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + Object (face(s), shell(s), solid(s)) +
Offset value.
\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object. 

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_offset "Transformation Operations".
