\b Isoline is a 3D curve built on a bounded face limited by <em> [Umin, Umax] </em> and <em> [Vmin, Vmax] </em>
values of U and V parameters. For all points of the isoline U or V parameter value is constant.

Result of this operation is either a single edge or a compound of edges.

To create an \b Isoline of a face in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Basic - > Isoline</b>.

In this dialog:
- Input or accept the default \b Name of the resulting shape. 
- Click the arrow button and select in the Object Browser or in the Viewer the \b Face, for which the Isoline is built. 
- Select along which coordinate: \b U-Isoline or \b V-Isoline the Isoline is built;
- Set \b Parameter (ranging from 0 to 1), which defines the proportion, at which a face is divided by the isoline.
If Parameter=0.5, the isoline is a median.
- Press "Apply" or "Apply & Close" button to get the result (an edge or a compound of several edges).

This operation can be performed using a <b>TUI Command:</b> 

<em>geompy.MakeIsoline(theFace, IsUIsoline, theParameter)</em>

<b>Arguments:</b> Name + Face + Type (True for U-Isoline; False for V-Isoline) + Parameter.

<b>Example:</b>

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of creation of 
\ref tui_creation_curve "Basic Geometric Objects".
