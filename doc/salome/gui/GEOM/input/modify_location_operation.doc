\page modify_location_operation_page Modify the Location

\n To <b>Modify the Location</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select 
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Modify the Location</b>.

\n This operation modifies the \b Location of \b Objects.

\n The first algorithm places the object(s) so that its center coincides
with the origin of the Local Coordinate System. 
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial objects, otherwise they
will be removed.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + End Coordinate System.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments".

\n In the picture the initial cube with the global coordinate system
is to the right and the modified cube with the Local Coordinate
System in the center of it is to the left .

\n The second algorithm  modifies the location of an object using Start
and End LSC, although the final position of the object will not
coincide with the center of  either of the two systems. In this method
the object is shifted from its initial position by the value of the
remainder after subtraction of the coordinates of the Start LSC from
the coordinates of the End LSC.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + Start Coordinate System + End
Coordinate System.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments".

In this picture we see the initial cube with the global coordinate
system and two LCS: LocalCS1 (GCS+100 along x-axis) and LocalCS2
(GCS+200 along x-axis)

\image html image1.gif

Selecting Start LCS = LCS1 and End LCS = LCS2, we obtain the
translated cube at the position (100;0;0)

\image html image2.gif

Selecting Start LCS = LCS2 and End LCS = LCS1, we obtain the
translated cube at the position (-100;0;0)

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePosition(theObject, theStartLCS,
theEndLCS),</em>  where \em theObject is a shape, location of which is
modified, \em theStartLCS is a location to move the shape from, \em
theEndLCS is a location to move the shape to.

\n Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use
of \ref tui_translation "Transformation Operations".
