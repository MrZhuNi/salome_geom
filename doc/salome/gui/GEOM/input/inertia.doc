The table displays:
- 3*3 matrix of its own moments of inertia (in rows <b> 1:1, 2:1</b> and <b>3:1</b>) and  
- the relative moments of inertia (in row <b>IX & IY & IZ</b>)

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.Inertia(Shape),</em> where \em Shape is
a shape for which the own matrix of inertia and the relative moments of inertia are
returned.
