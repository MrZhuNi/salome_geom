Also tool provide advanced output to indicate imperfections in the input shape.

This is just a TUI functionality.

<b>TUI Commands:</b>

<UL>

<LI> 
<em>geompy.CheckConformity(shape),</em> \n
where \n
\em shape is the shape checked for validity. \n
</LI>

The following functionality is available from the tool:
<LI>
<em>geompy.isValid()</em> 

</LI>

<LI>
<em>geompy.selfIntersected2D()</em> 
</LI>

<LI>
<em>geompy.interferingSubshapes(shapeType1, shapeType2),</em> 
where \n
\em shapeType1 is the first type of subshape. \n
\em shapeType2 is the second type of subshape. \n 
</LI>

<LI>
<em>geompy.smallEdges()</em> 
</LI>

<LI>
<em>geompy.distantShapes(shapeType, subShapeType, tolerance),</em> 
where \n
\em shapeType is the type of shape. \n
\em subShapeType is the type of subshape. \n
\em tolerance is available tolerance, by default used tolerance of sub-shape.
</LI>
