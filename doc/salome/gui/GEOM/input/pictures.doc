\page pictures_page Designing shapes from pictures

Some tools in GEOM allow you to create shapes, basing the design on imported pictures (engineering drawings, nautical charts ...) :

<ul>
<li>\subpage import_picture_page, such as engeneering drawings or nautical charts as a support for shape design.
<li>\subpage shape_recognition_page previously imported in the OCC viewer .
</ul>
