/*!\page partition_explanation Fuse, Partition and Compound usage

It is frequently asked about the difference between the above mentioned operations. It's indeed simple. Lets take the example of a cylinder and a box that you want to join together.

\section Fuse

The \b fuse operation will make a <b>single solid</b> from the two given solids :

\section Partition

The \b partition operation will do basically the same but it will <b>keep a face at the frontier between the two solids</b> (in brown on the picture below). 
This face is shared by the two solids, which means that this face is present only one time in the resulting shape and is a sub-shape of the box and a sub-shape of the cylinder.

This operation allows you to identify different areas in a shape (e.g. different materials) and to ensure a conformal mesh when meshing it later. Indeed the face at the frontier is meshed only one time.

\section Compound

When you build a \b compound by using the build -> compound operation you just make <b>an object that contains the two separate solids</b> like in a "bag".
The two solids remain unconnected. The compound is just a set of shapes, no more.
