\n To produce a \b Chamfer in the <b>Main Menu</b> select 
<b>Operations - > Chamfer</b>

\n This operation allows you to make chamfer of the edges of a Shape.
\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n To create chamfer on all edges of the given shape, you need to
define the <b>Main Object</b> to create a chamfer on and the \b
Dimension (radius) of the chamfer.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferAll(Shape, D)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 SHAPE + 1 value (Chamfer dimension).
\n <b>Advanced options</b> \ref preview_anchor "Preview"

\n In the algorithms below there exist two ways to define the \b
Dimension of the Chamfer
\n Firstly the \b Dimension can be defined via \b D1 and \b D2, which
represent the offset on the first and the second face forming the
edge. 
\n Secondly the \b Dimension can be defined via \b D, which represents
the offset on the first face, and the \b Angle, which is the angle
between the first face and the chamfer plane.   


\n To create chamfer on the specified edges of the given shape,  you
need to define the <b>Main Object</b> to create a fillet on, select
the two faces to which belongs the necessary common edge in the viewer
and define the \b Dimension of the Chamfer.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferEdge(Shape, D1, D2,
Face1, Face2),</em> where \em Shape is a shape to create a chamfer on,
\em D1 is a chamfer size along \em Face1, \em D2 is a chamfer size
along \em Face2, \em Face1 and \em Face2 are indices of faces in
Shape.

\n <b>Alternative TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferEdge(Shape, D, Angle,
Face1, Face2),</em> where \em D1 is a chamfer size along \em Face1 and
\em Angle is the angle between Face1 and the chamfer plane.

\n To create chamfer on the specified faces of the given shape,  you need
to define the <b>Main Object</b> to create a fillet on, select the
necessary faces the OCC Viewer and define the \b Dimension of the
Chamfer.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferFaces(Shape, D1, D2,
ListOfFaceID),</em> where \em Shape is a shape to create chamfer on,
\em D1 and D2 are chamfer sizes along faces from  \em
ListOfFaceID. For each Edge Face1 and Face2 are defined basing
on their indices.

\n <b>Alternative TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferFaces(Shape, D, Angle,
ListOfFaceID),</em> where \em D1 is a chamfer size along \em Face1 and
\em Angle is the angle between Face1 and the chamfer plane.

\n To create chamfer on an arbitrary set of edges of the given shape
to define the <b>Main Object</b> to create a fillet on, select the
necessary edges the OCC Viewer and define the \b Dimension of the
Chamfer.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferEdges(Shape, D1, D2,
ListOfEdgeID),</em> where \em Shape is a shape to create chamfer on,
\em D1 and D2 are chamfer sizes along faces defined by the algorithm
basing on \em ListOfEdgeID, which is a list of indices of edges in
\em Shape. For each Edge the algorithm selects Face1 and Face2 basing
on their indices.

\n <b>Alternative TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeChamferEdges(Shape, D, Angle,
ListOfEdgeID),</em> where \em D1 is a chamfer size along \em Face1 and
\em Angle is the angle between Face1 and the chamfer plane.
