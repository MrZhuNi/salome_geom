This operation allows extraction of sub-shapes from a given
shape.

To use this operation, select in the Main Menu <b>Operations -> Extract and Rebuild</b>.
The following dialog box appears:

\image html extract_rebuild.png "Extract and Rebuild Dialog"

In this dialog:
<ul>
<li> \b Name is a result object name.</li>
<li> <b>Main Object</b> is the main object selected for the operation. It is
possible to select the object in the Object Browser or in the viewer using
"selection" button.</li>
<li> <b>Sub-shape type</b> is the type filter for sub-shapes to be chosen
for the extraction.</li>
<li> <b>Filtered shapes</b> is the list of filtered sub-shape IDs available
for the extraction.</li>
<li> <b>Shapes to extract</b> is the list of sub-shape IDs to be extracted
grouped by shape types.</li>
<li> \b >> is the button to copy object IDs from <b>Filtered shapes</b> to
<b>Shapes to extract</b>.</li>
<li> \b << is the button to copy object IDs from <b>Shapes to extract</b> to
<b>Filtered shapes</b>.</li>
<li> <b>Show Only Selected</b> is the button to show objects selected in the
<b>Filtered shapes</b> list and hide all other objects.</li>
<li> <b>Hide Selected</b> is the button to hide objects selected in the
<b>Filtered shapes</b> list.</li>
<li> <b>Show all sub-shapes</b> is the button to show all objects from the
<b>Filtered shapes</b> list.</li>
<li> \b Rebuild is the button to perform extraction and show the operation
statistics.</li>
<li> The block of \b Statistics shows how many shapes of a certain type
are \b Removed, \b Modified and \b Added.</li>
<li> \b Apply is the button to create the result.</li>
<li> <b>Apply and Close</b> is the button to create the result and close
the dialog.</li>
<li> \b Close is the button to close this dialog.</li>
<li> \b Help is the button to show this help page.</li>
</ul>

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeExtraction(theShape, theListOfID),</em> 
<br> where \em theShape is the main shape, \em theListOfID is a list of
sub-shape IDs to be extracted.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful example of the use of
\ref swig_MakeExtraction "Extract and Rebuild" functionality.

<b>More details</b>

If a sub-shape is extracted, all its ancestors should be modified. An ancestors
of extracted sub-shapes can be either:
- created anew without extracted sub-shapes, or
- extracted if it is not possible to create a valid shape without extracted
sub-shape.

E.g. it is necessary to extract the vertex from the box:

In this case 3 ancestor edges are removed as they can't be valid without
this vertex. 3 faces that contain these edges are also removed. It is because
the wires without edges are not closed and it is not possible to create
a valid face on not closed wire. These wires should contain two remaining
edges, but they are removed as they are the part of the remaining shell.
So these wires become empty that means that they should be removed as well.

The shell is replaced by another one that contains 3 not modified faces. As
It is not possible to construct a valid solid from not closed shell the solid
is removed. So the result of the extraction is a shell that contains 3 faces:
