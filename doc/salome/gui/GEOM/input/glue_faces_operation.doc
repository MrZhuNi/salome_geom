\n To <b>Glue Faces</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Glue Faces</b>.


\n This operation glues faces that are coincident with respect to the
given tolerance value.

\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + Shapes + Tolerance value.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and sub-shapes from arguments".
\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>

<em>geompy.MakeGlueFaces( theShapes, theTolerance, doKeepNonSolids )</em>,
\n where \em theShapes is either a list or compound of shapes to be glued, \em
 theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces, which can
 be considered as coincident. The \em doKeepNonSolids flag allows to
 throw away non-solids from the result, if false. The \b Result will
 be a new \b GEOM_Object.

\n It is also possible to manually select the faces that will be 
glued - select the shape, specify the tolerance and press \b Detect button.

\n \b Geometry module detects the faces where gluing can be
performed and displays a notification.

\n The faces that can be glued are colored in red. It is
possible to select the faces for gluing in the 3D viewer.
The selected faces will be marked in white.

When the faces are glued their edges are glued as well. By default, other
edges are not glued. To force gluing of all edges, check <b>Glue all coincident edges</b>
check-box.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>

<em>geompy.GetGlueFaces( theShapes, theTolerance )</em>,
\n where \em theShapes is a list or compound of shapes to be glued, \em
theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces, which can
be considered as coincident. The \b Result will be a list of \b
GEOM_Objects (faces), containing one sub-shape per each detected set of
coincident sub-shapes. For example if there are two coincident faces
in selected shapes, the result list contains one of the two coincident faces.

<em>geompy.MakeGlueFacesByList( theShapes, theTolerance, theFaces,
  doKeepNonSolids, doGlueAllEdges )</em>,
\n where \em theShapes is either a list or compound of shapes to be glued, \em
 theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces, which can
 be considered as coincident, \em theFaces is a list of
 sub-shapes to be glued. The \em doKeepNonSolids flag allows to throw
 away non-solids from the result, if false. The \em doGlueAllEdges
 allows to glue all edges, not only owned by glued faces. The \b
 Result will be a new \b GEOM_Object.
