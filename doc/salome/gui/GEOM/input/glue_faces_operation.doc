\n To <b>Glue Faces</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Glue Faces</b>.
\n To <b>Glue Edges</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Glue Edges</b>.

\n This operation glues faces/edges that are coincident with respect to the
given tolerance value.

\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + Compound of shapes + Tolerance value.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments".
\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
 <em>geompy.MakeGlueFaces(theShape,theTolerance,doKeepNonSolids)</em> and
 <em>geompy.MakeGlueEdges(theShape,theTolerance)</em>,
 where \em theShape is a compound of shapes to be glued, \em
 theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces/edges, which can
 be considered as coincident. The \em doKeepNonSolids flag allows to
 throw away non-solids from the result, if false. The \b Result will
 be a new \b GEOM_Object.

\n It is also possible to manually select the faces/edges that will be 
glued - select the shape, specify the tolerance and press \b Detect button.

\n \b Geometry module detects the faces/edges where gluing can be
performed and displays a notification.

\n The faces/edges that can be glued are colored in red. It is
possible to select the faces/edges for gluing in the 3D viewer.
The selected faces/edges will be marked in white.

\n For faces gluing their edges are also glued. By default, other
edges are not glued (this concerns only Glue Faces, of course).
To force all edges gluing, check the "Glue all coincident edges"
checkbox.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
 <em>geompy.GetGlueFaces(theShape,theTolerance)</em> and
 <em>geompy.GetGlueEdges(theShape,theTolerance)</em>,
 where \em theShape is a compound of shapes to be glued, \em
 theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces/edges, which can
 be considered as coincident. The \b Result will be a list of \b
 GEOM_Objects, containing one sub shape per each detected set of
 coincident sub shapes.

\n <em>geompy.MakeGlueFacesByList(theShape,theTolerance,theFaces,doKeepNonSolids,doGlueAllEdges)</em>
 and <em>geompy.MakeGlueEdgesByList(theShape,theTolerance,theEdges)</em>,
 where \em theShape is a compound of shapes to be glued, \em
 theTolerance is a maximum distance between two faces/edges, which can
 be considered as coincident, \em theFaces/theEdges is a list of
 subshapes to be glued. The \em doKeepNonSolids flag allows to throw
 away non-solids from the result, if false. The \em doGlueAllEdges
 allows to glue all edges, not only owned by glued faces. The \b
 Result will be a new \b GEOM_Object.
