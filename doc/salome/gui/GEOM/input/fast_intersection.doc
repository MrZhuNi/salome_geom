\page fast_intersection_page Fast intersection

This operation checks whether or not two selected shape are overlapped.

\n This tool is useful for fast detection of intersections and gaps.
In contrast to Boolean Operations, Partition and Detect Self-intersection 
algorithms that compute topological intersections, this algoritm computes 
intersections by generating tessellation (triangulation) of the source 
shapes and detecting overlapping of resulting meshes. High performance is 
achieved through the use of existing triangulation of faces.

\note For more information about Partition and Boolean Operations Algorithms
and their limitations refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.

In this dialog:

- \b Object 1 - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- \b Object 2 - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.

\note This dialog supports navigation through the selectable objects (in OCC 3D viewer only):
- Scroll mouse wheel with pressed \em Ctrl key or press \em "S", \em "P" keys when input focus is
in the viewer to navigate between selectable objects.
- Press left mouse button to select an appropriate object to the dialog box.
.
For more details, please refer to the \em "Functionality common for OCC and VTK viewers" chapter
of the GUI module's documentation.

- <b>Deflection coefficient</b> desires the quality of tessellation.
\note Quality of the result depends on the quality of triangulation.
In some cases changing this coefficient can strongly affect the result.  
- <b>Detect gaps</b> - the check box that allows detecting small gaps with between shapes. 
- <b>Tolerance</b> distance between shapes used for detecting gaps.
- <b>Compute intersections</b> button computes interferences.
- <b>Sub-shapes of Object 1</b> - list of sub-shapes from first shape being checked that localize the intersection.
- <b>Sub-shapes of Object 2</b> - list of sub-shapes from second shape being checked that localize the intersection.
- \b Apply and <b>Apply and Close</b> buttons are used to store selected intersected shapes in the study for further analysis.

\note Result of this operation cannot be represented as a topological shape. Tool returns as 
the result a list of sub-shapes from each shape being checked that localize the intersection. 
The intersection will be published as a compound containing intersected sub-shapes from both source objects.
This result might be helpful to the user for further analysis of the initial shapes.

\n <b>Result:</b> Boolean, two lists of IDs of sub-shapes from shapes being checked that localize the intersection.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.FastIntersect(theShape1, theShape1, theTolerance = 0.0, theDeflection = 0.001),</em> \n
where: \n
\em theShape1 First shape. \n
\em  theShape2 Second shape. \n
\em  theTolerance  If negative or zero value,  it will be possible to detect intersections 
                   If non-zero positive value, it will be possible to detect gaps. \n
\em  theDeflection  Linear deflection for shapes.
                    If deflection <= 0, than use default deflection 0.001 \n
