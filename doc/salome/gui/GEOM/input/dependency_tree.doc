\anchor dependency_tree_general_description_anchor <h2>General description</h2>

In order to better understand the relations between the %GEOM 
objects in a study the user has a possibility to display the 
ascendants and descendant of the object(s) in a family tree.

User can build the dependency tree by selecting desirable object 
in Object Browser or OCC Viewer and calling "Show dependency tree" 
popup item. It will open a new or clear the existing "Dependency 
Tree" view window (only one view is supported) and display a 
dependency tree for the selected object or objects (multiple 
selection is supported). Also user can rebuild the tree if to select 
some object(s) right in the "Dependency Tree" view and call 
"Rebuild the tree" popup menu item.

User can change all necessary parameters of Dependency Tree Viewer 
in \ref pref_dependency_tree "Preferences".

\anchor dependency_tree_nodes_anchor <h2>Nodes</h2>

Tree nodes in the Dependency Viewer are named according to the study 
names of the corresponding objects. 

Non-published objects are shown in the tree as "unpublished" and 
colored in special color.

All nodes have the fixed size, so the long names are cut and shown 
with ellipsis; full name of the object can be seen in the tooltip 
if to keep the cursor over the node.

"Dependency Tree" view supports the following states of nodes:

<ul><li><b>Main node</b> - node of main object(s), which were selected in Object 
Browser, OCC Viewer or Dependency Tree Viewer in order to build the 
dependency tree;</li></ul>
\image html tree_main_node.png

<ul><li><b>Default node</b> - node of published in study object, which participate in building of 
dependency tree as ascendant or descendant;</li></ul>
\image html tree_default_node.png

<ul><li><b>Unpublished node</b> - the same as "Default node", but 
corresponding object was not published in study;</li></ul>
\image html tree_unpublished_node.png

<ul><li><b>Highlighted node</b> - the state of node when mouse 
cursor is over it;</li></ul>
\image html tree_highlighted_node.png

<ul><li><b>Selected node</b> - the state of node when user 
clicks the left mouse button on node.</li></ul>

\anchor dependency_tree_links_anchor <h2>Links</h2>

Dependency Tree Viewer shows oriented links between nodes to 
represent dependency direction. Viewer supports the following states 
of links:

<ul><li><b>Unidirectional link</b> - shows that A object depends on 
B object;</li></ul>
\image html tree_unidir_link.png

<ul><li><b>Bidirectional link</b> - shows that A object depends on 
B object and, at the same time, B object depends on 
A object;</li></ul>
\image html tree_bidir_link.png

<ul><li><b>Self-dependency link</b> - shows that object depends on 
itself;</li></ul>
\image html tree_selfdep_link.png

<ul><li><b>Cyclic dependency links</b> - shows cyclic dependency of 
some nodes.</li></ul>

\anchor dependency_tree_operations_anchor <h2>Operations</h2>

The dependency tree of a chosen %GEOM object is displayed in 
the dedicated 2D view window.
\n The functionalities of 2D viewer are available via its Viewer 
Toolbar. 

Buttons marked with small downward triangles have extended 
functionality which can be accessed by locking on them with left 
mouse button.

<b>Dump View</b> - exports an object from the viewer in bmp, png or
jpeg image format.
\image html tree_view_dump.png

<b>Fit all</b> - scales the presentation so that it could fit within
the Viewer boundaries.
\image html tree_view_fitall.png

<b>Fit area</b> - resizes the view to place in the visible area only
the contents of a frame drawn with pressed left mouse button.
\image html tree_view_fitarea.png

<b>Fit selection</b> - resizes the view to fit in the visible area
only currently selected objects.
\image html tree_view_fitselect.png

<b>Zoom</b> - allows to zoom in and out.
\image html tree_view_zoom.png

<b>Panning</b> - if the represented objects are greater that the
visible area and you don't wish to use <b>Fit all</b> functionality,
click on this button and you'll be able to drag the scene to see its
remote parts.
\image html tree_view_pan.png

<b>Global panning</b> - allows to select a point to be the center of
the presentation showing all displayed objects in the visible ares.
\image html tree_view_glpan.png

<b>Hierarchy depth</b> - allows to change the number of hierarchy 
levels to be shown in the dependency tree.
\image html tree_hierarchy_type.png
<ul>
<li>Level 1 corresponds to the parents and children of the selected 
object(s);</li>
<li>Level 2 is Level 1 plus the grand-parents and grand-children 
of the selected object(s);</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

<b>Display ascendants</b> - allows user to control the displaying 
of ascendants.
\image html tree_disp_ascendants.png

<b>Display descendants</b> - allows user to control the displaying 
of descendants.
\image html tree_disp_descendants.png

<b>Move nodes</b> - enables/disables of moving the nodes.
\image html tree_move_nodes.png

<b>Update</b> - allows user to update a dependency tree model and the view.

\anchor dependency_tree_navigation_anchor <h2>Navigation</h2>

Dependency Tree 2D Viewer supports the following navigation mode:

<ul>
<li>rectangle selection in this mode is performed by the left mouse 
button</li>;
<li>multiple selection is available when \b Shift button 
is pressed.</li>
</ul>

Also, holding \b Ctrl key with pressed mouse buttons performs 
the following view transformations:
<ul>
<li>Ctrl + left mouse button - zooming;</li>
<li>Ctrl + middle mouse button - panning;</li>
</ul>

<hr>
\anchor dependency_tree_popup_menu_anchor <h2>Popup Menu</h2>

After the object has appeared in the Dependency Tree 2D Viewer, 
user can select it with left mouse click to change its presentation 
parameters and get access to other useful options by right-clicking on 
the selected object.

\image html tree_popup_menu1.png

<ul>
<li>\b Show - allows to show selected object(s) in OCC 3D Viewer;</li>
<li><b> Show Only</b> - allows to show only selected object(s) 
in OCC 3D Viewer;</li>
<li><b> Rebuild the tree</b> - allows to rebuild the dependency tree 
for selected object(s);</li>
<li>\ref reduce_study_page "Reduce study" - allows to reduce study.</li>
</ul>

Some functionalities are available through right-clicking on 
the viewer background:
