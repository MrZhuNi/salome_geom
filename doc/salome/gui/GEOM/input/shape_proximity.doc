\page shape_proximity_page Shape Proximity

The Shape Proximity operation calculates maximal of all possible distances between two shapes.

This is just a TUI functionality. The provided class
<pre>
geompy.ShapeProximity()
</pre>
has an interface to compute proximity value with default parameters
<pre>
p = geompy.ShapeProximity()
value = p.proximity(shape1, shape2)
</pre>

Moreover, it also provides the functionality to customize the calculation. 
For example, compute coarse proximity value basing on the number of sampling points for each shape, 
or compute the precise value as a refining operation after the coarse value calculation.
<pre>
p = geompy.ShapeProximity()
p.setShapes(shape1, shape2) # customize calculator with input shapes
p.setSampling(shape1, 100)  # assign number of sample points for the first shape
p.setSampling(shape2, 25)   # assign number of sample points for the second shape
coarse_proximity = p.coarseProximity() # rough proximity value basing on the shape sampling and tessellation
fine_proximity = p.preciseProximity()  # more precise proximity value using exact shapes
</pre>
