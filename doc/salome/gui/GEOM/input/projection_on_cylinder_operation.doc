\page projection_on_cylinder_operation_page Projection on Cylinder

\n To produce a <b>Projection on Cylinder</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Projection on Cylinder</b>

\n This operation makes a projection of a <b>Source planar wire or face</b> on
a cylinder defined by its radius. The cylinder's coordinate system is
the same as the global coordinate system. The result represents a wire or
a face that represents a projection of the source shape onto a cylinder.

To make a projection it is necessary to define:
- \b Object to be projected. It can be either a planar wire or a face;
- \b Radius of the cylinder;
- <b>Starting angle</b> from the cylinder's X axis around Z axis. This is
the angle of the projection start.
- <b>Length angle</b> where the total length of
the wire should be projected. If it is unchecked the projection is not scaled and the natural
wire length is kept for the projection.
- <b>Rotation angle</b> the angle between the tangent vector to
the first curve at the first point of the object projection in 2D space
and U-direction of the cylinder in 2D space.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeProjectionOnCylinder(theObject, theRadius,
theStartAngle=0.0, theAngleLength=-1.0, theAngleRotation=0.0),</em>
where \em theObject is a shape to be projected, \em theRadius
is a cylinder radius, \em theStartAngle is the starting angle of projection in
radians, \em theAngleLength the projection length angle in radians,
\em theAngleRotation projection rotation angle in radians.
The \em Result will be a \em GEOM_Object.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
