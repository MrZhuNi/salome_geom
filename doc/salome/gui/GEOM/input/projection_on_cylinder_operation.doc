\page projection_on_cylinder_operation_page Projection on Cylinder

\n To produce a <b>Projection on Cylinder</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Projection on Cylinder</b>

\n This operation makes a projection of a <b>Source planar wire or face</b> on
a cylinder defined by its radius. The cylinder's coordinate system is
the same as the global coordinate system. The result represents a wire or
a face or a compound of faces that represents a projection of the source
shape onto a cylinder.

To make a projection it is necessary to define:
- \b Object to be rotated. It can be either a planar wire or a face;
- \b Radius of the cylinder;
- <b>Starting angle</b> from the cylinder's X axis around Z axis. This is
the angle of the projection starting.
- <b>Length angle</b> in which to project the total length of
the wire. If it is unchecked the projection is not scaled and natural
wire length is kept for the projection.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeProjectionOnCylinder(theObject, theRadius,
theStartAngle=0.0, theAngleLength=-1.0),</em>
where \em theObject is a shape which has to be projected, \em theRadius
is a cylinder radius, \em theStartAngle the starting angle of projection in
radians, \em theAngleLength the projection length angle in radians.
The \em Result will be a \em GEOM_Object.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
