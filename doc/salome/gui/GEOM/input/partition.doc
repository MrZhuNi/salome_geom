\n To produce a \b Partition in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Operations - > Partition</b>

\n This operation builds a compound by intersection of several shapes with a tool object or a plane.
\n The \b Result will be any \b GEOM_Object.

<br><h2>Intersection of two shapes.</h2>

\n As far as the intersection of two objects can produce any type of
geometrical objects, <b>Resulting type</b> box allows choosing the
preferrable result, i.e. a solid, a shell, a list of faces, etc.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePartition(ListOfShapes,
ListOfTools, ListOfKeepInside, ListOfRemoveInside, Limit, RemoveWebs,
ListOfMaterials),</em> where where \em ListOfShapes is a list of shapes to
be intersected and \em ListOfTools is a list of shapes to intersect the
shapes from ListOfShapes.
\n Since the implementation of a new version of PartitionAlgo other
parameters are ignored by the current functionality and remain there
only to support the old scripts.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 2 lists of shapes (the shapes from the
first list will be intersected with the shapes from the second list) +
reconstruction limit.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments".

<b>Keep shapes of lower type</b> checkbox allows building geometrical objects. 
Only lower type objects will be preserved without the upper ones.


<br><h2>Intersection of a Shape and a Plane.</h2>

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em> geompy.MakeHalfPartition(Shapes,
Plane),</em> where \em Shapes are a list of Shapes to be intersected
and \em Plane is a Tool shape, to intersect the \em Shapes.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + a list of shapes which will be intersected
+ 1 cutting plane.
\n <b>Advanced option:</b>
   \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments".
