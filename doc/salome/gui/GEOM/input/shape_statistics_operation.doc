\page shape_statistics_operation_page Shape Statistics

This operation allows plotting a distribution histogram for the numerical parameters and creating the corresponding geometrical groups of the given shape.

To call <b>Shape Statistics</b> dialog box, in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Inspection - > Shape Statistics</b>.

In this dialog:
- "Selected objects" standard selection box allows selecting one or more geometrical objects.

- "Type" combo-box with the following items: "Edges length", "Faces area", "Solids volume".
\note "Type" combo-box includes only parameters applied to the currently selected shape (e.g. "Solids volume" will not be available for a selected face or shell); multiple selection is processed correspondingly (i.e. only types applicable for all selected shapes will be available).

- "Number of intervals" spin box is used to specify number of distribution histogram ranges.

- "Scalar range" checkable group box, when switched ON, allows specifying custom values range used for plotting and creating groups.
\note By default, "Scalar range" controls are empty; pressing "Compute" button allows automatically computing the initial range of the chosen parameter. This is necessary as the computation of the parameters range can be time-consuming for large or complex models. In case of multiple selection, the scalar range is computed for all selected shapes.

- "Plot" button opens or uses an opened Plot2d viewer and plots the distribution histogram for the selected shape(s).

- "Create groups" button allows creating groups according to the currently specified parameters. The group names will include numerical values of the range, e.g. "Edges_length_0-20", "Edges_length_20-40", etc. Empty groups are not created.

- Close dialog box, by pressing <b>Close</b> button.

\note This functionality is available only if GUI module is built with Plot 2D Viewer (option SALOME_USE_PLOT2DVIEWER is ON when building GUI module).
