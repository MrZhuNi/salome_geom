need to indicate an \b Object to be translated, a \b Vector of
translation, a \b Step of translation and a <b>Number of Times</b> the
Object should be duplicated.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeMultiTranslation1D(Shape, Dir,
Step, NbTimes)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 vector (for direction) + 1

\n To produce a <b>Double Multi Translation</b> (in two directions) you need to
indicate an \b Object to be translated, and, for both axes, a \b
Vector of translation, a \b Step of translation and a <b>Number of Times</b> the shape must be duplicated.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeMultiTranslation2D(Shape, Dir1,
Step1, NbTimes1, Dir2, Step2, NbTimes2),</em> where \em Shape is a shape
to be translated, \em Dir1 is the first direction of translation, \em Step1 of
the first translation, \em NbTimes1 is a number of translations to be done
along \em Dir1, \em Dir2 is the second direction of translation, \em Step2 of the
second translation, \em NbTimes2 is a number of translations to be done
along \em Dir2.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 2 vectors defining the direction
+ 2 step values + 2 values (repetitions).
