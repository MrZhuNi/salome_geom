To create a <b> Smoothing Surface</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Advanced - > SmoothingSurface </b>

\image html smoothingsurface_dlg.png

In this dialog you can specify the following parameters:
- \b Name of the surface; 
- the list of \b Points or compounds of points, from which it is approximated;
- <b>Max nbr of Bezier pieces</b> in the resulting surface;
- <b>Max BSpline surface degree</b> of the resulting BSpline surface;
- <b>3D tolerance of initial approximation</b>

\note <b>3D tolerance of the initial approximation</b> represents the tolerance of
initial plate surface approximation. If this parameter is equal to 0 (default),
its value is automatically computed as <em> max(0.0001, 10*error)</em>,
where <em>error</em> is the 3D tolerance of the surface representing the maximal
distance between the computed plate surface and given points.

<b>Advanced options:</b> \ref preview_anchor "Preview"

Press "Apply" or "Apply & Close" button to get the resulting <em>GEOM_Object(Surface)</em>.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeSmoothingSurface(thelPoints, theNbMax, theDegMax, theDMax)</em>, where:
- \em thelPoints is a list of points or compounds of points;
- \em theNbMax maximum number of Bezier pieces in the resulting surface;
- \em theDegMax maximum degree;  
- \em theDMax specifies 3D tolerance of the initial approximation.
