<h2> Context Menu </h2>

Newly created or imported geometrical objects are listed in the Object Browser. 
The following commands appear in the Object Browser context menu under certain conditions:

<ul>
<li>\ref work_with_groups_page "Create Group" - allows creating groups of geometrical objects.</li>

<li><b>Conceal child items</b> / <b>Disclose child items</b> - hides / shows child
sub-objects in the Object Browser, if the selected geometric object has
child objects. When some child objects are hidden, the name of the
parent object is highlighted with bold font.</li>

<li><b>Show Only Children</b> - erases from the current viewer all objects
and then displays only the children of the selected object(s).
</li>

\anchor publish_hidden_objects
<li><b>Unpublish</b> - hides the selected geometric object from the Object Browser 
  and erases it from all viewers. To publish unpublished geometric objects select in the 
  context menu of the <b>Geometry</b> root object <b>Publish...</b> item. 
  The following dialog box will appear

  \image html publish_dlg.png <br>

  Switch the check-box near the appropriate object and
  click <b>Publish</b> or <b>Publish And Close</b> button. 

  "Eye" icons in this dialog box allow previewing unpublished objects in the viewer. By default all 
  unpublished objects are sorted by name in ascending order. It is possible
  to change the order (ascending / descending) by clicking the corresponding title bar of the objects list.
</li>

<li>\ref dependency_tree_page "Show dependency tree" - shows the dependency tree with parents and children of the selected object
in a new 2D View Window.</li>

<li>\ref reduce_study_page "Reduce study" - allows reducing the study by removing objects from it.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Folders </h2>

In the Object Browser it is possible to classify geometrical objects into folders.

To create a folder select <b> Create folder</b> item in the context menu of the root \b Geometry Object Browser item or in another folder.

The objects can be added into folders by drag and drop 

\note Only two categories of objects can be moved into folder:
- geometrical model(s) under root "Geometry" item or under any folder;
- another folder.

If a geometrical object has more than one child sub-object, it is possible to sort them in ascending order by selecting <b>Sort children</b> context menu item of the parent object.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of 
\ref tui_arranging_study_objects "Arranging objects in study".

<h2>Information Window</h2>
At the bottom of the Object Browser, there is \b Information
window providing some information on a selected geometric object:

- <b>Creation operation</b> shows a name of the operation
used to create the selected object.
- The table below lists \b Parameters used to create the
selected object and their \b Values.
