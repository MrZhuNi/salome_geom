\page create_extrusion_alongpath_page Pipe Construction

To generate a \b Pipe in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Generation  - > Extrusion along a path</b>

\n Firstly, to create an extruded \b Pipe shape, you can define the <b>Base
Object</b> (vertex, edge, planar wire, face or shell), which will be extruded
and the <b>Path Object</b> (edge or wire) along which the <b>Base 
Object</b> will be extruded.<br>
It is possible to select in GUI several Base Objects to make several pipes (using Shift button).
\n In this mode the default pipe generation algorithm is used. The pipe
is created so that the <b>angle between the normal vector</b> to
the base shape <b>and the tangent to the path</b> wire remains constant at any point of the
given path.
\n <b>Select unpublished edges</b> checkbox - if checked, allows to select an edge of any other shape as the path object. 
\n <b>Generate groups</b> checkbox - if checked allows to create groups of
sub-shapes. For more details on groups creation please refer to
\ref create_groups_page "this description".
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge, face, shell,
solid or compsolid).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePipe(baseShape, pathShape,
 IsGenerateGroups=False)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape (vertex, edge, planar wire, face or
shell) serving as base object + 1 shape (edge or wire) for
definition of the path + 1 boolean parameter (IsGenerateGroups).

\n Secondly, you can define the <b>Base
Object</b> (edge, planar wire or face), which will be extruded, 
the <b>Path Object</b> (edge or wire) along which the <b>Base 
Object</b> will be extruded and the <b>BiNormal Vector</b> (edge or
wire).

\n In contrast to the default mode, in this mode the pipe is generated
to preserve the constant <b>angle between the normal vector</b> to the base
shape <b>and the BiNormal vector</b> given as the third argument.
\n <b>Select unpublished edges</b> checkbox - if checked, allows to select an edge of any other shape as the path object. 
\n <b>Generate groups</b> checkbox - if checked allows to create groups of
sub-shapes. For more details on groups creation please refer to
\ref create_groups_page "this description".
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge, face, shell,
solid or compsolid).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePipeBiNormalAlongVector(baseShape, pathShape, binormalShape,
 IsGenerateGroups=False)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape (edge, planar wire or face) 
serving as base object + 1 shape (edge or wire) for
definition of the path + 1 shape (edge or wire) to set a fixed 
BiNormal direction to perform the extrusion + 1 boolean parameter
(IsGenerateGroups).

<b>Example:</b>

\n Thirdly, it is possible to additionally select profiles of the pipe object to be built. For this, you can define the following parameters:
- <b>Base Object</b> or a list of objects (edges, planar wires, faces or shells), which will be extruded;
- <b>Locations</b> - a vertex or a list of vertices that specify the locations of extruded <b>Base Objects</b> on the resulting <b>Path Object</b>. The number of Base Objects should be equal to the number of <b>Locations</b>.
- <b>Path Object</b> (edge or wire), along which the <b>Base Object</b> will be extruded.

Additional controls:
- If <b>With contact</b> is checked, the section is translated in contact with the spine.
- If <b>With correction</b> is checked, the section is rotated to be orthogonal to the spine
tangent in the corresponding point.
- If <b>Step-by-step generation</b> is checked, the result is created
step-by-step, i.e. it creates pipes between each pair of neighbor sections and
fuses them into a single shape.

\note If <b>Step-by-step generation</b> is checked, <b>With contact</b> and
<b>With correction</b> controls are disabled as corrections of bases are
not allowed in step-by-step mode.

<b>Generate groups</b> checkbox - if checked allows to create groups of
sub-shapes. For more details on groups creation please refer to
\ref create_groups_page "this description".
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a shell or a solid.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
- <em>geompy.MakePipeWithDifferentSections(baseShape, locations, pathShape, withContact, withCorrection,
 IsGenerateGroups=False)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + list of shapes (edges, planar wires, faces or shells) serving as base object + 
list of locations (vertices) on the path corresponding specified list of the shapes + 
1 shape (edge or wire) for definition of the path + 
3 Boolean parameters (withContact, withCorrection, IsGenerateGroups).
- <em>geompy.MakePipeWithDifferentSectionsBySteps(baseShape, locations, pathShape,
 IsGenerateGroups=False)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + list of shapes (edges, planar wires, faces or shells) serving as base object +
list of locations (vertices) on the path corresponding specified list of the shapes +
1 shape (edge or wire) for definition of the path +
Boolean parameter.
