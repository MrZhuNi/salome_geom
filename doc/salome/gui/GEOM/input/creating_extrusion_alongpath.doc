\page create_extrusion_alongpath_page Pipe Construction

To generate a \b Pipe in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Generation  - > Extrusion along a path</b>

\n Firstly, to create an extruded \b Pipe shape, you can define the <b>Base
Object</b> (vertex, edge, planar wire, face or shell), which will be extruded
and the <b>Path Object</b> (edge or wire) along which the <b>Base 
Object</b> will be extruded.
\n In this mode the default pipe generation algorithm is used. The pipe
is created in such a way that the <b>angle between the normal vector</b> to
the base shape <b>and the tangent to the path</b> wire at any point of the
given path <b>is kept constant</b>.
\n Check Box <b>Select unpublished edges</b> - if checked, allows to select an edge of any other shape as the path object. 
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge, face, shell,
solid or compsolid).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePipe(baseShape, pathShape)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape (vertex, edge, planar wire, face or
shell) serving as base object + 1 shape (edge or wire) for
definition of the path.

\n Secondly, you can define the <b>Base
Object</b> (edge, planar wire or face), which will be extruded, 
the <b>Path Object</b> (edge or wire) along which the <b>Base 
Object</b> will be extruded and the <b>Vector</b> (edge or wire).
\n In contrast to the default mode, in this mode the pipe is generated
in such a way that the <b>angle between the normal vector</b> to the base
shape <b>and the BiNormal vector</b> given as the third argument <b>is kept
constant</b>.
\n Check Box <b>Select unpublished edges</b> - if checked, allows to select an edge of any other shape as the path object. 
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge, face, shell,
solid or compsolid).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePipeBiNormalAlongVector(baseShape, pathShape, binormalShape)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape (edge, planar wire or face) 
serving as base object + 1 shape (edge or wire) for
definition of the path + 1 shape (edge or wire) to set a fixed 
BiNormal direction to perform the extrusion.
