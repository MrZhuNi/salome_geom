<h2>Introduction</h2>

Below are some general notions about blocks:

A block is a an elementary geometric solid that has specific
geometric constraints oriented for meshing. In the hexahedral case,
blocks have 6 faces and each face has 4 edges.

Tetrahedral Block - is a block with constraints for tetrahedral
meshing.

Hexahedral Block - is a block with constraints for hexahedral meshing.

Block Compound - is a compound composed of blocks only.

These functionalities are available from the main menu via <em>New
Entity / Blocks</em>.

\anchor quad_face_anchor
<h2>Quadrangle face</h2>

\n <b>Description:</b> Builds a face using the below mentioned
arguments. This operation allows to build a face bypassing the
intermediate stage of building edges and wires (in the case of
building by 4 points) or wires (in the case of building by 4 or 2
edges).

\n The \b Result of the operation will be a \b GEOM_Object (face).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<ul>
<li><em>geompy.MakeQuad4Vertices(V1, V2, V3, V4),</em> where V1, V2,
V3, V4 are four vertices from which a face is constructed. Edges are
created automatically.</li>
<li><em>geompy.MakeQuad2Edges(E1, E2),</em> where E1, E2 are edges from
which the face is constructed, two other edges are created
automatically.</li>
<li><em>geompy.MakeQuad(E1, E2, E3, E4),</em> where E1, E2, E3, E4 are
four edges from which the face is constructed.</li>
</ul>

<b>Arguments:</b>
<ul>
<li>Name + 4 Points, or</li>
<li>Name + 2 Edges, or</li>
<li>Name + 4 Edges.</li>
</ul>

\anchor hexa_solid_anchor
<h2>Hexahedral solid</h2>

\n <b>Description:</b> Builds a hexahedral solid. either of the below
mentioned arguments. This operation allows to build a solid bypassing
the intermediate stage of building a shell and 4 faces (in the case of
building by 2 faces) or just a shell (in the case of building by 6
faces).

\n The \b Result of the operation will be a \b GEOM_Object (solid).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<ul>
<li><em>geompy.MakeHexa2Faces(F1, F2),</em> where F1 and F2 are faces
from which the hexahedron is constructed, other four faces are created
automatically.</li>
<li><em>geompy.MakeHexa(F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6),</em> where F1 &mdash; F6 are six faces from which the hexahedron is constructed.</li>
</ul>

\n <b>Arguments:</b>
<ul>
<li>Name + 2 Faces, or</li>
<li>Name + 6 Faces.</li>
</ul>
