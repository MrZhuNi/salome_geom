<h2>Introduction</h2>

Below are some general notions about blocks:

A block is a an elementary geometric solid that has specific
geometric constraints oriented for meshing. In the hexahedral case,
blocks have 6 faces and each face has 4 edges.

Tetrahedral Block - is a block with constraints for tetrahedral
meshing.

Hexahedral Block - is a block with constraints for hexahedral meshing.

Block Compound - is a compound composed of blocks only.

Some functionalities that allow building blocks easily are available from the main menu via <em>New
Entity / Blocks</em>.
