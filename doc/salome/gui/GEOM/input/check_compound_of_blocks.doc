\page check_compound_of_blocks_page Check Compound of Blocks

This operation checks whether a shape is a compound of glued blocks
and improves the shape to include only valid blocks.

To be considered as a compound of blocks, the given shape must satisfy the
following conditions:
- Each element of the compound should be a Block, i.e. have 6 quadrangle faces;
- Each quadrangle face should have one wire with four edges. If there are
more than four edges in a single wire and C1 continuity mode is switched on,
a face is quadrangular if it has four bounds with C1 continuity.
- Blocks can be connected only via an entire quadrangle face or an entire edge;
- The compound should be connected;
- Each couple of connecting quadrangle faces should be glued.


In this dialog:

- \b Object - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- <b>Use C1 criterion</b> - option switches on/off the C1 continuity mode.
- <b>Angular Tolerance</b> - angular tolerance to check C1 continuity between neighbor edges in a wire.
- \b Errors list informs of possible errors, for example:
	- Not a block;
	- Not glued;
	- Not connected;
	- Extra or degenerated edge.
- <b>Incriminated Sub-shapes</b> field outputs the list of sub-shapes that cause problem.
- \b Apply and <b>Apply and Close</b> buttons launch the improvement process
and publish the result shape, which includes valid blocks only. The
algorithm tries to:
   - remove seam and degenerated edges from surfaces of revolution;
   - re-approximate surfaces to exclude singularities on boundaries;
   - unite edges and faces;
   - glue faces.


\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<em>geompy.CheckCompoundOfBlocks(Compound, theIsUseC1 = False, theAngTolerance = 1.e-12).</em> Checks if the shape
is a valid compound of blocks. If it is true, then the validity flag
is returned, and encountered errors are printed in the python console.
