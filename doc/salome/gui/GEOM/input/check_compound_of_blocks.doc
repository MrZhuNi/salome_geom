\page check_compound_of_blocks_page Check Compound of Blocks

This operation checks whether a shape is a compound of glued blocks.

To be considered as a compound of blocks, the given shape must satisfy the
following conditions:
- Each element of the compound should be a Block (6 quadrangle faces);
- Each quadrangle face is a face that has 1 wire with 4 edges. If there are
more than 4 edges in a single wire and C1 continuity mode is switched on,
a face is quadrangular if it has 4 bounds of C1 continuity.
- Blocks can be connected only via an entire quadrangle face or an entire edge;
- The compound should be connected;
- Each couple of connecting quadrangle faces should be glued.


In this dialog:

- \b Object - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- <b>Use C1 criterion</b> - option what shitches on/off the C1 continuity mode.
- <b>Angular Tolerance</b> - angular tolerance to check C1 continuity between neighbor edges in a wire.
- \b Errors list informs of possible errors, for example:
	- Not a block;
	- Not glued;
	- Not connected;
	- Extra or degenerated edge.
- <b>Incriminated Sub-shapes</b> field outputs the list of sub-shapes that cause problem. It is possible to select them in the list and publish in the study for further analysis by clicking \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. 


\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<em>geompy.CheckCompoundOfBlocks(Compound, theIsUseC1 = False, theAngTolerance = 1.e-12).</em> Checks if the shape
is a valid compound of blocks. If it is true, then the validity flag
is returned, and encountered errors are printed in the python console.
