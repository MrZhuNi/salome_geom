\image html measures2.png

This operation retrieves all non block solids and faces from the given
shape in two groups: solids and faces separately.

Two or less groups are published in the Object
Browser under the processed object. An error is raised if
no bad sub-shapes (solids and faces) have been found.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<em>geompy.GetNonBlocks(Compound).</em> Returns a tuple of two
    GEOM_Objects. The first object is a group of all non block solids
    (not having 6 faces, or having 6 faces, but some of them
    are not quadrangular). The second object is a group of all non
    quadrangular faces.
