Retrieve all non blocks solids and faces from the given shape.
Collect them in two groups: solids and faces separately.

\n <b>Result:</b> Two or less groups are published in the Object
                  Browser under the processed object. Reports error if
                  no bad sub-shapes (solids and faces) have been found.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<em>geompy.GetNonBlocks(Compound).</em> Returns a tuple of two
    GEOM_Objects. The first object is a group of all non block solids
    (= not 6 faces, or with 6 faces, but with the presence of
    non-quadrangular faces). The second object is a group of all non
    quadrangular faces.
