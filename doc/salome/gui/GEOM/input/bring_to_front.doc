\page bring_to_front_page Bring To Front

\n This option is relevant for better viewing of complex 3D models. 
It allows to bring to the viewer foreground the selected geometrical object.

Let's take for example two coincident primitives: a box and a cylinder.

In the first picture the box has been visually superimposed over the
cylinder using <b>Bring to front</b> option.

In the second picture the box has been returned to its normal state
using <b>Clear Top Level State</b> context menu command, however, the
cylinder has been brought to front.
