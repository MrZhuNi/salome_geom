\n To produce a <b>Multi Rotation</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Multi Rotation</b>

\n This operation creates several geometrical objects rotated in one
or two dimensions basing on the initial geometrical object.
\n The \b Result will be one or several \b GEOM_Objects (compound).

\n To produce a <b>Simple Multi Rotation</b> (in one dimension) you
need to define a \b Shape to be rotated, an \b Axis of rotation and a
<b>Number of Times</b> the shape must be rotated. <b>Rotation Angle</b> will
be 2*PI/NbTimes
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MultiRotate1D(Shape, Axis, NbTimes)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 vector for direction + 1 value
(repetition).

\b There is a <b>TUI</b>-only command
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation1D(Shape, Dir, Point, NbTimes)</em> which works in
the same way, but the Axis is defined  by direction and point.

\n <b>Double Multi Rotation</b> (in two dimensions) rotates the given
\b Object around the given \b Axis on the given \b Angle a given
<b>Number of Times</b> and multi-translates each rotation
result. Translation direction passes through the center of gravity of
the rotated shape and its projection on the rotation axis.
\b Reverse checkbox allows to set the direction of rotation.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MultiRotate2D(Shape, Axis, Angle, NbTimes1, Step, NbTimes2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 vector for direction + 1 angle
+ 1 value (repetition) + 1 step value + 1 value (repetition).

There is a <b>TUI</b>-only command 
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation2D(Shape, Dir, Point, Angle, nbtimes1, Step,nbtimes2)</em>
which works in the same way,
but the Axis is defined  by direction and point.
