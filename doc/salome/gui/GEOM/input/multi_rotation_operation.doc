\n To produce a <b>Multi Rotation</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Multi Rotation</b>

\n This operation creates a compound of several shapes rotated in one
or two dimensions basing on the initial shape.
\n The \b Result will be one \b GEOM_Object (compound).

\n To produce a <b>Simple Multi Rotation</b> (in one dimension) you
need to define a \b Shape to be rotated, an \b Axis of rotation (DZ by
default), Angle of rotation (optionally) and a <b>Number of Times</b>
the shape must be rotated. If <b>Angular step</b> is not defined
(checkbox is not checked), it will be 2 * \a PI / \a NbTimes. Number
of shape's copies in the resulting compound will be equal to
\a NbTimes (if \a NbTimes = 1, the result will contain only the
initial non-transformed shape).

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate1DNbTimes(Shape, Axis, NbTimes)</em>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate1DByStep(Shape, Axis, AngleStep, NbTimes)</em>

\b <b>NB!</b> There is another way to execute a Multi-rotation
operation, which is currently accessible only via TUI commands:
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation1DNbTimes(Shape, Dir, Point, NbTimes)</em>,
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation1DByStep(Shape, Dir, Point, AngleStep, NbTimes)</em>,
which works in the same way, but the Axis is defined by direction and point.

\n <b>Double Multi Rotation</b> (in two dimensions) rotates the given
\b Object around the given \b Axis (DZ by default) on the given
\b Angle (optional) a given <b>Number of Times</b> and
multi-translates each rotation result.
If <b>Angular step</b> is not defined (checkbox is not checked), it
will be 2 * \a PI / \a NbTimes.
Translation direction passes through the center of gravity of the
initial shape and its projection on the rotation axis. Number of
shape's copies in the resulting compound will be equal to \a NbTimes1 x \a NbTimes2
(if both \a NbTimes1 and \a NbTimes2 are equal to 1, the result will contain
only the initial non-transformed shape).
\b Reverse checkbox allows to set the direction of rotation.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate2DNbTimes(Shape, Axis, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate2DByStep(Shape, Axis, AngleStep, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>

<b>NB!</b> There is another way to execute a Double Multi-rotation
operation, which is currently accessible only via TUI commands: 
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation2DNbTimes(Shape, Dir, Point, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>,
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation2DByStep(Shape, Dir, Point, AngleStep, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>,
which works in the same way, but the Axis is defined by direction and point.
