\n To produce an \b Archimede operation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Archimede</b>

\n This operation creates a plane corresponding to the modeled
water-line of the object plunged into the water (in Z direction).

\n The \b Result will be any \b GEOM_Object.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b>
<em>geompy.Archimede(Shape,Weight,WaterDensity,MeshingDeflection),</em>
 where \em Shape is a shape to put into the water, \em Weight is a weight of
the shape, \em WaterDensity  is density of water, \em MeshingDeflection is a
deflection of the mesh, using to compute the section.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape  + 3 values (Weight, Water Density
& Meshing Deflection).
\n <b>Advanced options</b> \ref preview_anchor "Preview"
