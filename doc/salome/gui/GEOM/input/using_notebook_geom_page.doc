\page using_notebook_geom_page Using SALOME NoteBook

It is possible to use variables defined through <b>SALOME NoteBook</b> for
creation and modification of objects in the Geometry module with the following
limitations:

<ul>
<li> \ref create_lcs_page "Local Coordinate System" dialog box.\n
     The notebook parameters are correctly applied, but the study
     update is problematic in case if the LCS is defined using an 
     object whose dimensions are given by parameters.
<li> \ref color_page "Select color" dialog box.
<li> \ref isolines_page "Select Number of Isos" dialog box.
</ul>

Here is an example of using of variables, which were previously set by
SALOME NoteBook, in Geometry GUI:
