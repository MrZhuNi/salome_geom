\n You can change the representation of the geometrical vertices in
the 3D viewer either by selecting one of the predefined
shapes or by loading a custom texture from an external file.

- Standard point markers

The Geometry module provides a set of predefined point marker shapes which
can be used to display vertices in 3D viewer.
Each standard point marker has two attributes: type (defines shape
form) and scale factor (defines shape size).

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>go.SetMarkerStd(Type, Size)</em>.

- Custom point markers

It is also possible to load a point marker shape from an external file.
This file should provide a description of the point texture as a set
of lines; each line is represented as sequence of "0" and "1" symbols,
where "1" symbol means an opaque pixel and "0" symbol means a
transparent pixel. The width of the texture correspond to the length
of the longest line in the file, expanded to the nearest byte-aligned
value. The height of the texture is equal to the number of non-empty
lines in the file. Note that missing symbols are replaced by "0".

Here is a texture file sample:
