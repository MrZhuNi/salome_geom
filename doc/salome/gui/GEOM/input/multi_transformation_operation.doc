\n To produce a <b>Multi Transformation</b> operation in the <b>Main
Menu</b> select <b>Operations - > Blocks - > Multi Transformation</b>

\n This operation makes several translations of a block (solid) in one
or two directions depending on the arguments specified by the user.
\n The \b Result in both cases will be a \b GEOM_Object.

<br><h2>Simple Multi Transformation (in one direction)</h2>

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em> geompy. MakeMultiTransformation1D(Block,
DirFaceID1, DirFaceID2, NbTimes),</em> where \em Block is a block to be
transformed, \em DirFaceID1 is an ID of the face which defines the first
direction of transformation, \em DirFaceID2 is an ID of the face which
defines the second direction of transformation, \em NbTimes is a number of
transformations.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 hexahedral solid + 1 or 2 faces + 1
integer (number of blocks).
\n <b>Advanced options</b> \ref preview_anchor "Preview"

<br><h2>Double Multi Transformation (in two directions)</h2>

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy. MakeMultiTransformation2D(Block,
DirFaceID1U, DirFaceID2U, NbTimesU, DirFaceID1V, DirFaceID2V,
NbTimesV),</em> where \em Block is a block to be transformed, \em DirFaceID1U
and \em DirFaceID2U are IDs of the faces, which define directions of the
first transformation, \em DirFaceID1V and \em DirFaceID2V are ID's of the
faces which define directions of the second transformation, \em NbTimesU
and \em NbTimesV are numbers of transformations.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 hexahedral solid + 2, 3 or 4 faces + 2
integers (number of blocks).
\n <b>Advanced options</b> \ref preview_anchor "Preview"
