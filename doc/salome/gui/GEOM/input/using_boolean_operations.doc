\page using_boolean_operations_page Using Boolean Operations

\n You can use the following boolean operations for construction of more
complex geometrical objects (2D & 3D elements):

<ul>
<li>\subpage fuse_operation_page "Fuse" - creates a shape from two shapes.</li>
<li>\subpage common_operation_page "Common" - transforms the common part
of two objects into an independent object.</li>
<li>\subpage cut_operation_page "Cut" - cuts one shape with
another. </li>
<li>\subpage section_opeartion_page "Section" - creates a section between two shapes.</li>
</ul>

There is a general TUI command covering all these operations, which
can be used alongside with separate commands for each operation.
\par
<em>geompy.MakeBoolean(Shape1, Shape2, Operation),</em> where \em
Shape1 is the first argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of
Boolean operation, \em Operation is a type of the Boolean operation (1
&mdash; Common, 2 &mdash; Cut, 3 &mdash; Fuse, 4 &mdash; Section).


Besides, you can use advanced TUI commands performing these operations
independently from each other:
\par
<em>geompy.MakeFuse(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 and \em
Shape2 is the second argument of Fuse operation; 
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCommon(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 and \em
Shape2 is the second argument of Common operation;
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCut(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 and \em
Shape2 is the second argument of Cut operation;
\par
<em>geompy.MakeSection(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 and \em
Shape2 is the second argument of Section operation;

\n Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of 
\ref tui_boolean_operations_page "Boolean Operations".
