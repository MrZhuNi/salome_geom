\page transfer_data_page Transfer Data

This operation performs copying of non-topological data
from one shape to another. The topology of the destination object
will not change, only non-topological data will be transferred
(if it is present in the source object). It is possible to transfer
the following data with this operation:
<ul>
<li> <b>Names</b></li>
<li> <b>Materials</b></li>
</ul>

To use this operation, select in the Main Menu <b>Operations -> Transfer Data</b>.
The following dialog box will appear.

In this dialog:
<ul>
<li> <b>Source Shape</b> is an object that is a source of non-topological data.</li>
<li> <b>Destination Shape</b> is a data destination object. </li>
<li> <b>Type of detection operation</b> allows choosing how to search sub-shapes of the 
     <b>Source Shape</b> in the <b>Destination Shape</b>. The data are transferred
     from these corresponding sub-shapes. The following methods are possible:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Get In Place</b> - the current implementation of Get In Place algorithm
        (default value).</li>
    <li><b>Get In Place (old)</b> - the old implementation of Get In Place
        algorithm.</li>
    <li><b>Get In Place By History</b> - Get In Place By History algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

To copy the data click on \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. 
It is possible to see how many names and materials are copied as well as
the maximum number of names and materials available for copying. This information is
provided in the following message box:

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.TransferData(ObjectFrom, ObjectTo, FindMethod),</em> 
<br> where \em ObjectFrom is a data source object, \em ObjectTo is a
destination object and \em FindMethod is a same shape detection method with
default value \em GEOM.FSM_GetInPlace.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful example of the use of
\ref swig_TransferData "Transfer Data" functionality.
