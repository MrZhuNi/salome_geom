\page transfer_data_page Transfer Data

This operation performs copying of non-topological data
from one shape to another. The topology of the destination object
will not change, only non-topological data will be transferred
(if it is present in the source object). It is possible to transfer
the following data with this operation:
<ul>
<li> <b>Names</b></li>
<li> <b>Materials</b></li>
</ul>

To use this operation, select in the Main Menu <b>Operations -> Transfer Data</b>.
The following dialog box will appear.

In this dialog:
<ul>
<li> <b>Source Shape</b> is an object that is a source of non-topological data.</li>
<li> <b>Destination Shape</b> is a data destination object. </li>
<li> <b>Type of detection operation</b> is the method to search sub-shapes of
     <b>Source Shape</b> in <b>Destination Shape</b>. Data are transferred
     from these corresponding sub-shapes. This is a combo-box with the following
     possible values:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Get In Place</b> - current implementation of Get In Place algorithm
        (default value).</li>
    <li><b>Get In Place (old)</b> - old implementation of Get In Place
        algorithm.</li>
    <li><b>Get In Place By History</b> - Get In Place By History algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

To copy data click on \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. As the result
it is possible to see how many names and materials are copied as well as
maximum number of names and materials available for copying. This information is
provided on the following message box:

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.TransferData(ObjectFrom, ObjectTo, FindMethod),</em> 
<br> where \em ObjectFrom is a data source object, \em ObjectTo is a
destination object and \em FindMethod is a same shape detection method with
default value \em GEOM.FSM_GetInPlace.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful example of the use of
\ref swig_TransferData "Transfer Data" functionality.
