\page angle_page Angle

This operation returns the angle in degrees between two lines or linear edges.

\n The appropriate "local" selection is automatically switched on. If there are several entities of allowed types under the mouse cursor, first of them (top-level one) is highlighted. 
Press <CTRL> button and scroll the mouse wheel to switch between different available shapes that are pointed by the mouse cursor. The corresponding entities are highlighted in the viewer. 
Press left mouse button to select appropriate object to the dialog box.

If both objects are <b>vectors</b>, the angle is computed in accordance with their orientations, otherwise the minimum angle is computed.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.GetAngle(shape1, shape2),</em> where
Shape1 and Shape2 are shapes between which the angle is computed. 
Another TUI command is <em>geompy.GetAngleRadians(shape1,shape2),</em> 
which returns the value of angle in radians.
