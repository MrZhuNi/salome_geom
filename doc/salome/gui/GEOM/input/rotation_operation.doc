\n To produce a \b Rotation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select 
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Rotation</b>

\n This operation \b rotates the initial shape.

\n The first \b Rotation algorithm needs you to define an \b Object to
be rotated, an \b Axis of rotation and an \b Angle of rotation.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeRotation(Shape, Axis, Angle)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> 1 shape + 1 vector for direction of rotation + 1
angle.

\b Reverse checkbox allows to specify the direction of rotation.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.
\n The \b Result will be any \b GEOM_Object.

\n The second algorithm allows to define the rotated \b Object by
three points. Rotation axis will pass through the <b>Central Point</b>
and will be will be orthogonal to a plane defned by three points. In
this case rotation \b Angle is the angle between two vectors directed
from the first point to the second and to the third.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeRotationThreePoints(Shape, CentralPoint, Point1, Point2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> 1 shape + 3 points.
