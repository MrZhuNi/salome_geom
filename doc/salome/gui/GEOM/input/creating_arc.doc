To create an \b Arc in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Basic - > Arc</b>

\n There are 2 algorithms to create an \b Arc in the 3D space.
\n The \b Result of each operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge).

\n Firstly, you can define an \b Arc by three \b Points that lie on it,
where Point1 is the starting point, Point2 is a middle point of the
arc and Point3 is the ending point of the arc.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeArc(Point1, Point2, Point3)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 vertices.

\n Secondly, you can define an \b Arc by \b Center, \b Start and \b End
points. The arc is built from the \b Start point to the \b End point. The
radius of the arc is defined by the distance between the \b Center point
and the \b Start point. The \b End point defines the angle of the arc. If
the distance between the \b Center point and the \b End point is not equal
to the radius, the arc will be built anyway.
\n \b Reverse radio button allows to change the direction of the arc.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeArcCenter(Center Point, Start
Point, End Point, boolean Sense)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 vertices + Boolean.
