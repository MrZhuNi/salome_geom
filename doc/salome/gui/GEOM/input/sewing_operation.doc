\b Sewing operation allows uniting several faces (possibly contained
in a shell, solid or compound) into one shell. Geometrically
coincident (within a specified tolerance) edges (or parts of edges) of
different faces are replaced by one edge thus producing a shell of
faces with shared boundaries.<p> 
This operation is similar to <b>New Entity - > Build - > Shell</b>
operation, the difference is that with \b Sewing you can specify the
tolerance and get a non-manifold result. <p>
The possibility to create a non-manifold shell can be used e.g. to create a
shell forming several closed domains and then to create several solids
with shared boundaries from this shell.

\note Geometrically coincident faces (or parts of faces) will not be
replaced by one face during \b Sewing.

To produce a \b Sewing operation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Sewing</b>.

The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object (shell).

In this dialog: 
- Click on the "Arrow" button and select in the Object Browser or in the viewer one or more \b Shapes (faces or shells) to be sewn.
- Activate <b>Allow Non Manifold </b> check-box to produce non-manifold sewing, if required.
- Define precision for sewing in \b Tolerance field.
- Activate <b> Detect Free boundaries</b> button to display the number of free boundaries in the shape:

- Click \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button.

This operation can be also launched using a <b>TUI Command:</b>

<em>geompy.MakeSewing(ListOfShape, Precision, AllowNonManifold=False),</em>

where \em ListOfShape is a list of faces or shells to be sewn, \em Precision is a
precision for sewing, \em AllowNonManifold is a flag that allows non-manifold sewing.

<b>Example:</b>

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_sewing "Repairing Operations".
