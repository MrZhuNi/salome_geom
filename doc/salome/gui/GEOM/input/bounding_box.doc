\page bounding_box_page Bounding Box

Returns the dimensions of the bounding box for the selected
geometrical object.

\note In order to take into account any possible distortion of a shape 
that affects the resulting bounding box, the algorithm enlarges 
the bounding box to the value of the maximum deflection value of 
faces (by iterating through all faces of a shape).
This functionallity is implemented in such a way in order to have 
satisfactory performance.

<b>Result:</b> Displays the dimensions of the bounding box of a
geometrical object in the form of Python Tuple (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin,
Ymax, Zmin, Zmax).
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.BoundingBox(Shape),</em> where \em Shape
is a shape for which a bounding box is computed.
