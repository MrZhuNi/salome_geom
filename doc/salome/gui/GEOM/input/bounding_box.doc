The coordinates of two corners of its bounding box are shown in the table. 

Press \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to publish the bounding \b Box in the study. 

\note This dialog supports navigation through the selectable objects (in OCC 3D viewer only):
- Scroll mouse wheel with pressed \em Ctrl key or press \em "S", \em "P" keys when input focus is
in the viewer to navigate between selectable objects.
- Press left mouse button to select an appropriate object to the dialog box.
.
For more details, please refer to the \em "Functionality common for OCC and VTK viewers" chapter
of the GUI module's documentation.

<b>TUI Commands:</b> <em>[Xmin,Xmax, Ymin,Ymax, Zmin,Zmax] = geompy.BoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>,
<em>BBox = geompy.MakeBoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>, where \em Shape
is the shape for which the bounding box is computed. \em precise TRUE
 for precise computation; FALSE for fast one. Default value is False.
