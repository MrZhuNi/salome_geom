\page bounding_box_page Bounding Box

This operation performs precise computation of bounding box for the selected geometrical object and displays its dimensions.

\n The appropriate "local" selection is automatically switched on. If there are several entities of allowed types under the mouse cursor, first of them (top-level one) is highlighted. 
Press <CTRL> button and scroll the mouse wheel to switch between different available shapes that are pointed by the mouse cursor. The corresponding entities are highlighted in the viewer. 
Press left mouse button to select appropriate object to the dialog box.

The coordinates of two corners of its bounding box are shown in the table. 

Press \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to publish the bounding \b Box in the study. 

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b> <em>[Xmin,Xmax, Ymin,Ymax, Zmin,Zmax] = geompy.BoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>,
<em>BBox = geompy.MakeBoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>, where \em Shape
is the shape for which the bounding box is computed. \em precise TRUE
 for precise computation; FALSE for fast one. Default value is False.
