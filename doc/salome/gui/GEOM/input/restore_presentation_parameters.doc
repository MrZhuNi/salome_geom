\page restore_presentation_parameters_page Restore presentation parameters and a tree of subshapes

\n This functionality allows the operation result to inherit colour
and subshapes from its arguments.

\n To activate this functionality, one should check the "Set
presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments" checkbox in
corresponding dialog.

\n Let us view an example to understand, how it works.
Before the partitioning we had box Box_1 with two published faces and
cylinder Cylinder_1 with free published edges. After the partition we
have also resulting object with several subshapes, that corresponds to
operation arguments and their published subshapes. We performed two
partitions: Partition_1 result obtained by partitioning two objects
Box_1 and Cylinder_1 as objects, with no tool, Partiton_2 obtained by
partitioning Box_1 object with Cylinder_1 tool:

\n If all the shapes and subshapes have their own colours before the
partitioning, the resultiong shape and its automatically generated
subshapes will inherit these colours.

\n If the resulting shape corresponds to its first argument (like
after transformation or after the boolean operation Cut, or after the
partiton with one object shape), it inherits its colour, and also
inherits its subshapes (like Partition_2).

\n In the case, when the resulting shape composed from multiple arguments
(like after boolean operations, except Cut, or after the partition with
several object shapes, or it is a compound), it will have default
colour, but its generated subshapes, corresponding to arguments and
their subshapes, will inherit corresponding colours. And in this case
it will have generated subshapes, corresponding to the arguments (like
Partition_1).

\n See the picture before the partition:

\n And the picture, displaying only the Partition_2 with subshapes:

\n You can also call this functionality from your python scripts.
See our <b>TUI Scripts</b> for \ref tui_restore_prs_params "example".
