\page restore_presentation_parameters_page Restore presentation parameters and a tree of subshapes

\n This functionality allows the operation result to inherit colour
and subshapes from its arguments.

\n To activate this functionality, check in "Set
presentation parameters and subshapes from arguments" checkbox in the
corresponding dialog.

\n For example, there exist two objects: Box_1 with two published
faces and Cylinder_1 with free published edges.

\image html restore-ss-viewer-before.png

First, we examine the case when the resulting shape corresponds to one argument (after transformation, 
after the boolean operation Cut, or after the partiton with one object shape). 

We create a Cut of Box_1 with Cylinder_1.

\image html restore-ss-cut.png

The resulting shape inherits the subshapes and the colour of Box_1.

Second, we examine the case when the  resulting shape is composed from multiple arguments
(after all boolean operations, except for Cut, or after the partition with
several object shapes, or if the resulting shape is a compound).

We create a Common of Box_1 and Cylinder_1.

\n The resulting object is created with several subshapes that correspond to the
operation arguments and their published subshapes. The resulting shape
has a default colour, but its subshapes inherit colors corresponding
to arguments and their subshapes.

Please, note that when the resulting shape corresponds to one
argument, the inherited subshapes depend directly on the resulting shape.

When the resulting shape is composed from multiple arguments, the 
inherited subshapes depend on the arguments.

\n You can also call this functionality from your python scripts.
See our <b>TUI Scripts</b> for \ref tui_restore_prs_params "example".
