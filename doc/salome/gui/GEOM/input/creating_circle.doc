To create a \b Circle in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Basic - > Circle</b>

\n There are 3 algorithms to create a \b Circle in the 3D space. 
\n The \b Result of each operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge).

\n Firstly, you can define a \b Circle by a <b>Center Point</b>, a \b
Vector giving the circle's normal and a \b Radius.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeCircle(Point, Vector,
Radius)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 vertex (for the center) + 1 edge (for
the direction) + Radius.

\note Passing None as <b>Center Point</b> means Origin of global
coordinate system, passing None as \b Vector means OZ axis of global
coordinate system.

\n Secondly, you can define a \b Circle by three \b Points that lie on it. 
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeCircleThreePnt(Point1, Point2, Point3)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 points which will form the circle.

\n Finally, you can define a circle by a <b>Center Point</b> and two
\b Points.  
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeCircleCenter2Pnt(Point1, Point2,
Point3)</em>, where Point1 is the center of the circle, the distance
between point1 and Point2 is the radius of the circle and Point3 helps
to define the plane where the circle lies.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 points.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of creation of
