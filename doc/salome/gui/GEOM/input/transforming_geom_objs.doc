\page transform_geom_obj_page Transforming geometrical objects

The objects created in Salome can be processed with Transformation
operations, which can be classified into:   

<ul>
<li>\subpage using_boolean_operations_page  "Boolean operations", which allow combining objects
with boolean logical operators.</li>
<li>\subpage transformation_operations_page "Transformation operations", 
which modify shape or location of the selected object.</li>

<li>\subpage features_page "Features", 
which allow adding or removing matter from an object.</li>

<li>Operations with \subpage blocks_operations_page "Blocks".</li>

<li>\subpage partition_page "Partition" operation, which creates a compound
by intersection of several shapes with a tool object or a plane.</li>
<li>\subpage archimede_page "Archimede" operation, which creates a
plane corresponding to the modelled waterline of the object plunged
into water.</li>
<li>\subpage shapesonshape_page "Get shapes on shape" operation, a
special case of \b Explode operation. </li>
<li>\subpage shared_shapes_page "Get shared shapes" operation, a
special case of \b Explode operation. </li>
<li>\subpage transfer_data_page "Transfer Data" operation, which copies
non-topological data from one shape to another. </li>
<li>\subpage extract_and_rebuild_page "Extract and Rebuild" operation, which
extracts sub-shapes from the main shape. </li>


<li>\subpage restore_presentation_parameters_page "Restore presentation parameters". 
This cross-operation functionality allows the resulting shape to
inherit colors and sub-shapes from its parent shapes.</li>
</ul>
