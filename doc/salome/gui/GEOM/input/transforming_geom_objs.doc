The objects created in Salome can be processed with Transformation
operations, which can be classified into:   

<ul>
<li>\subpage using_boolean_operations_page  "Boolean operations" using
Boolean logical operators.</li>
<li>\subpage transformation_operations_page "Transformation operations", 
which modify shape or location of the selected object.</li>

<li>\subpage partition_page "Partition" operation, which creates a compound
by intersection of several shapes with a tool object or a plane.</li>
<li>\subpage archimede_page "Archimede" operation, which creates a
plane corresponding to the modelled waterline of the object plunged
into water.</li>
<li>\subpage shapesonshape_page "Get shapes on shape" operation, a
special case of \b Explode operation. </li>

<li>Operations with \subpage blocks_operations_page "Blocks".</li>


<li>\subpage restore_presentation_parameters_page "Restore presentation pareameters". 
This cross-operation functionality allows the resulting shape to
inherit colors and subshapes from its parent shapes.</li>
</ul>
