\page check_self_intersections_page Detect Self-intersections

\n Checks the topology of the selected shape to detect self-intersections.
 Returns True if there are no self-intersections. Reports pairs of
 intersected sub-shapes, if there are any.

\note This tool is useful for detection of shapes, not suitable for
arguments of Boolean operations and Partition algorithm.
For more information about Partition and Boolean Operations Algorithms
and their limitations refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.

\n <b>Result:</b> Boolean.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.CheckSelfIntersections(theShape),</em>
where \em theShape is the shape checked for validity.
