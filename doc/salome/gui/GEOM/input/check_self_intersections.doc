\page check_self_intersections_page Detect Self-intersections

This operation checks the topology of the selected shape to detect self-intersections.

In this dialog:

- \b Object - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- <b>Level of check</b> - combo box allows setting the level of self-interference checking. It defines, which interferences will be checked. The default value is "All interferences".
- <b>Compute self-intersections</b> button performs the computation.
- \b Summary section contains the general report about self-intersections of the object and/or errors that occurred during the computation.
- \b Self-intersections list contains the list of detected self-intersections. Select the intersection to show <b>Sub-shapes</b> in the field to the right. 
- \b Apply and <b>Apply and Close</b> buttons store the interferences selected in the <b>Self-intersections</b> list box in the study for further analysis. 
If no interferences are selected, all of them are published in the study. Each interference is published as a child compound of the source shape and contains a couple of intersecting sub-shapes.

\note This tool is useful for detection of shapes that are not suitable as
arguments of Boolean operations and Partition algorithm.
For more information about Partition and Boolean Operations Algorithms
and their limitations refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.

\n <b>Result:</b> Boolean.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.CheckSelfIntersections(theShape, theCheckLevel = GEOM.SI_ALL),</em> \n
where: \n
\em theShape is the shape checked for validity. \n
\em theCheckLevel is the level of check. Default value is GEOM.SI_ALL to check all interferences.
