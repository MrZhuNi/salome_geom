\page check_self_intersections_page Detect Self-intersections

This operation checks the topology of the selected shape to detect self-intersections.

In this dialog:

- \b Object - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- <b>Level of check</b> - The combo box that allows to set the level of checking shape on self-interference.
  It defines which interferferences will be checked. Default value is "All interferences".
- <b>Compute self-intersections</b> button computes self-interferences.
- \b Summary section contains the general report if the object has self-intersections and/or if errors are occured during computation.
- \b Self-intersections list contains the list of self-intersections detected.
Select the intersection to show <b>Sub-shapes</b> in the field to the right. 
- \b Apply and <b>Apply and Close</b> buttons are used to store selected self-intersected shapes in the study for further analysis.
If no shapes are selected, but an intersection is selected the both of intersected shapes are stored. If no intersections selected
all shapes of all intersections are stored in the study.

\note This tool is useful for detection of shapes, not suitable for
arguments of Boolean operations and Partition algorithm.
For more information about Partition and Boolean Operations Algorithms
and their limitations refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.

\n <b>Result:</b> Boolean.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.CheckSelfIntersections(theShape, theCheckLevel = GEOM.SI_ALL),</em> \n
where: \n
\em theShape is the shape checked for validity. \n
\em theCheckLevel is the level of check. Default value is GEOM.SI_ALL to check all interferences.
