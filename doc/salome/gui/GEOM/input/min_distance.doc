\page min_distance_page Minimum Distance

This operation returns the minimum distance between two geometrical objects.

The query for minimum distance can find one or more solutions, or even an infinite set of solutions. 
However, the currently used OCCT algorithm finds a finite number of
solutions even if an infinite set of solutions exists.

Select one of the found solutions in the \b Solution list to display it in the Viewer show values corresponding to this solution in the following fields:
- \b Length - the distance value;
- \b DX, \b DY and \b DZ the vector coordinates. 

Press \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to create a set of closest
points, corresponding to all found solutions.

\note This dialog supports navigation through the selectable objects (in OCC 3D viewer only):
- Scroll mouse wheel with pressed \em Ctrl key or press \em "S", \em "P" keys when input focus is
in the viewer to navigate between selectable objects.
- Press left mouse button to select an appropriate object to the dialog box.
.
For more details, please refer to the \em "Functionality common for OCC and VTK viewers" chapter
of the GUI module's documentation.

<b>TUI Commands:</b>
- <em>aDist = geompy.MinDistance(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
- <em>[aDist, DX, DY, DZ] = geompy.MinDistanceComponents(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
- <em>[nbSols, (x11, y11, z11, x21, y21, z21, ...)] = geompy.ClosestPoints(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
.
where \em Shape1 and \em Shape2 are the shapes, between which the minimal
distance is computed.
