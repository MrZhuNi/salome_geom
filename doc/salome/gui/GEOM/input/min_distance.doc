\page min_distance_page Min. Distance

Returns the minimum distance between two geometrical objects and
the coordinates of the vector of distance and shows the distance in
the viewer.

\note The minimal distance searching task can have one or more
solutions, and also it can have an infinite set of solutions. All
found solutions are listed in dedicated combobox. When the user
selects any one of found solutions, presentation is displayed in the
OCC viewer and fields "Length", "DX", "DY" and "DZ" are filled with
corresponding values. If there are no solutions found, text "No
solution found" will be shown instead of solutions list; this could
mean what the task has an infinite number of solutions.

\n \note Currently used OCCT functionality finds finite number of
solutions even in cases, where an infinite set of solutions exists.

\n On \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> it creates a set of closest
points of the shapes, corresponding to all found solutions.

<b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n<em>aDist = geompy.MinDistance(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
\n<em>[aDist, DX, DY, DZ] = geompy.MinDistanceComponents(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
\n<em>[nbSols, (x11, y11, z11, x21, y21, z21, ...)] = geompy.ClosestPoints(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
\n where \em Shape1 and \em Shape2 are shapes between which the minimal
distance is computed.
