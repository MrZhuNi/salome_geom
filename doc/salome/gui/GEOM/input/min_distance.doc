\page min_distance_page Min. Distance

Returns the minimum distance between two geometrical objects and
the coordinates of the vector of distance and shows the vector in the viewer.

\n On \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> it creates a set of closest
points of the shapes.

<b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n<em>aDist = geompy.MinDistance(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
\n<em>[aDist, DX, DY, DZ] = geompy.MinDistanceComponents(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
\n<em>[nbSols, (x11, y11, z11, x21, y21, z21, ...)] = geompy.ClosestPoints(Shape1, Shape2),</em>
where \em Shape1 and \em Shape2 are shapes between which the minimal
distance is computed.
