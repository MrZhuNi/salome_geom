To create an \b Ellipse in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Basic - > Ellipse</b>

\n You can define an \b Ellipse by its <b>Center Point</b>, a \b
Vector giving its normal, and its <b>Major & Minor Radiuses</b>.
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeEllipse(Point, Vector, RadiusMajor, RadiusMinor)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 vertex (for the center) + 1 edge (for
the direction) + 1 X Radius + 1 Y Radius.

\note By default it is presumed that the <b>Center Point</b> is located at the  Origin of the global
coordinate system, and the  \b Vector corresponds to OZ axis of the global
