\page create_groups_page Generation of Groups

This option is available in some dialogs. To activate it please check
<b>Generate Groups</b> check box. When it is checked, it is possible to define
the prefix for generated groups names using <b>Group Names Prefix</b> input
field.

The groups are created along with the result of the operation when
\b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button is clicked. Each generated group
represents a set of sub-shapes of the result that satisfies certain conditions.
The groups of the following types can be generated:
 - \b Down - sub-shapes starting the result, e.g. bottom lid
for the pipe creation operation.
 - \b Up - sub-shapes ending the result, e.g. top lid
for the pipe creation operation.
 - \b Side1, \b Side2 - sub-shapes corresponding to each side
of the result.
 - \b Other - faces generated from the bounding edges of
\b Down group.

The groups are named according to the following naming rule:
If <b>Group Names Prefix</b> is set <b><Prefix>_<Type></b>, otherwise
the name is \b <Type>. The following figure shows group names created with
the prefix \b Group:

The general behavior of this functionality is the following:
<ul>
<li>If <b>Generate Groups</b> option is not set, the groups are not generated.</li>
<li>If starting and ending sub-shapes of the result are the same, e.g. if there is
a closed path for pipe construction, <b>Generate Groups</b> option is disabled
in the dialog box:</li>

\n
<li>Otherwise If the path is not closed edge/wire, the groups are created depending
on the profile:</li>
<ul>
<li>Profile is unclosed edge or wire: \b Down, \b Up, \b Side1, \b Side2:</li>

\image html gen_group_sides.png "Pipe with created groups Down(Red), Up(Green), Side1(Blue) and Side2(Yellow)"
\n
<li>Profile is closed edge or wire, face or shell: \b Down, \b Up, \b Other:</li>

\image html gen_group_other.png "Created groups Down(Red), Up(Green) and Other(Yellow)"
</ul>
</ul>

\b Down and \b Up groups contain:
- Edges if the profile is edge or wire;
- Faces if the profile is face or shell.

\b Side1 and \b Side2 groups contain edges generated from the first and
last vertices of the profile edge or wire correspondingly. The first and
last vertices are determined taking into account edge/wire orientation.

\b Other group represents faces generated from the bounding edges of profile.

The behavior in TUI is the following:
- Each Python function that supports groups generation has a flag
\b IsGenerateGroups which is equal to \b False by default.
- If \b IsGenerateGroups is not set the groups are not created; the returned
value is GEOM_Object that represents a result of the operation.
- If \b IsGenerateGroups is set the operation returns a list of GEOM_Object.
Its first element is a result, the remaining ones are the groups in the order:
\b Down, \b Up, \b Side1, \b Side2 for opened profile or \b Down, \b Up,
\b Other for closed profile.
- If \b IsGenerateGroups is set and the path is closed an error occurs.
