\page create_filling_page Filling Surface with Edges

To generate a \b Filling in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Generation  - > Filling</b>

To create a curvilinear face from several edges you need to define the
following parameters:
\n <b>Input Compound</b> - the list of edges/wires used for creation
of the surface. To prepare for the filling each wire of the compound
is converted to an edge created on a BSpline curve built using curves
from all edges of the wire.
\n \b Minimum and <b>Maximum Degree</b> of equation of the resulting
BSpline or Besier curves describing the surface; 
\n \b Tolerance for \b 2D and for \b 3D - minimum distance between the
created surface and the reference edge; 
\n <b>Number of Iterations</b> - defines the maximum number of iterations. The
iterations are repeated until the required tolerance is reached. So, a
greater number of iterations allows producing a better surface. 
\n <b>Method</b> - Kind of method to perform filling operation

<ol>
<li>Default - the standard behaviour.</li>
<li>Use edges orientation - the edges orientation is used: if an edge is
reversed, the curve from this edge is reversed before being used by the filling
algorithm.</li>
<li>Auto-correct edges orientation - curves orientation is changed to 
minimize the sum of distances between ends points of edges.</li>
</ol>

\n <b>Approximation</b> - if checked, BSpline curves are generated in
the process of surface construction (using
GeomAPI_PointsToBSplineSurface functionality). By default the surface
is created using Besier curves. The usage of <b>Approximation</b>
slows the algorithm, but allows building the surface for complex cases. 

\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (face).
