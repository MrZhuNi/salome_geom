\n To produce a <b>Limit Tolerance</b> operation in the <b>Main
   Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Limit Tolerance</b>.

\image html limit_tolerance_dlg.png

\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 value (new tolerance).

\n It is possible on all kind of shapes.

\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n This functionality tries to set new value of tolerance for the
   given shape. But the final tolerance value depends also on the
   initial shape topology (regards existing gaps) in order to obtain
   valid resulting shape.

\n Example of usage:
<ol>
<li>Try a partition on objects obj1 and obj2.</li>
<li>Partition fails.</li>
<li>Perform Limit Tolerance on objects obj1 and obj2.</li>
<li>Try again the partition.</li>
</ol>
See also \ref tui_limit_tolerance "TUI example".

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.LimitTolerance(Shape, Tolerance),</em>
 where \em Shape is a shape with presumably incorrect tolerance, \em
 Tolerance is a desired value of tolerance.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_limit_tolerance "Repairing Operations".
