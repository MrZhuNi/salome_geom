\n To produce a <b>Limit Tolerance</b> operation in the <b>Main
   Menu</b> select <b>Repair - > Limit Tolerance</b>.

\image html limit_tolerance_dlg.png

\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 value (new tolerance).

\n It is possible on all kind of shapes.

\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n This functionality tries to set a new value of tolerance for the
   given shape. However, the final tolerance value also depends on the
   initial shape topology (takes into consideration the existing gaps) to obtain
   a valid resulting shape.

\n Example of usage:
<ol>
<li>Partition objects obj1 and obj2.</li>
<li>Partition fails.</li>
<li>Perform Limit Tolerance on objects obj1 and obj2.</li>
<li>Try to partition them again.</li>
</ol>
See also \ref tui_limit_tolerance "TUI example".

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.LimitTolerance(Shape, Tolerance),</em>
 where \em Shape is a shape with presumably incorrect tolerance, \em
 Tolerance is the required tolerance value.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of
\ref tui_limit_tolerance "Repairing Operations".
