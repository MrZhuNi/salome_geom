\page create_squareface_page Rectangle

A primitive called \b Rectangle is a rectangular face of certain dimensions and orientation

To create a \b Rectangle  in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Primitives - > Rectangle</b>

\n There are 2 algorithms to create a \b Rectangle in the 3D space. 
\n The \b Result of each operation will be a GEOM_Object (Face).

\n Firstly, you can create a \b Rectangle at the origin 
of coordinates defining its boundaries by the height and the width and its axis by the orientation
radio buttons (OXY, OYZ or OZX).This 
means that the \b Rectangle will lie in "OXY", "OYZ" or "OZX" plane correspondingly.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceHW(Height, Width, Orientation)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 values (Dimensions at origin: heigth, width and
orientation).

\n Secondly, you can define a \b Rectangle by the height and the width sizes and an \b Edge defining the normal to the center of the face.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceObjHW(Vector, Height, Width)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 Vector (normal to the center) + 2 doubles (to
describe a face sizes).

\n It is also possible to create a \b Rectangle from another selected face. For this, switch the <b>Object Type</b> button 
to \b Face, then select a face object and set the values of
Height and Width for the new face. The created face will lie in the plane of the selected face.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceObjHW(Face, Height, Width)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 Face + 2 parameters (to describe a face sizes).
