To create a \b Disk in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Primitives - > Face</b>

\n There are 2 algorithms to create a \b Face in 3D space. 
\n The \b Result of each operation will be a GEOM_Object (Face).

\n Firstly, you can create a \b Face by the given height and width at the origin 
of coordinates. You can define the axis of the face by the orientation
group buttons. There are three options to create a face in OXY, OYZ or OZX Planes.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceHW(Height, Width, Orientation)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 3 values (Dimensions at origin: heigth, width and
orientation).
\n The orientation can be defined by "1", "2" or "3" values. This 
means that the Disk will lie in "OXY", "OYZ" or "OZX" plane correspondingly.

\n Secondly, you can define a \b Face by a \b Vector giving the face's normal to the center and 
\b Heigth and Width sizes.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceObjHW(Vector, Height, Width)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 Vector (normale to the center) + 2 doubles (to
describe a face sizes).
\n You can also create face from another selected face. Just turn the <b>Object Type</b> button 
to condition \b Face, then you can select a face object and set new values of
Height and Width for the newly face. The created face will lie in the plane
of the selected face.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceObjHW(Face, Height, Width)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 Face + 2 parameters (to describe a face sizes).
