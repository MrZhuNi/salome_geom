\section io_general General information

In Geometry module you can import and export geometrical objects
from/into \b BREP, \b IGES, \b STEP, \b STL, \b XAO, \b VTK (only export)
and others files. 
The mechanisms of import and export are implemented via plugins, 
which gives the opportunity to expand the range of available formats 
by adding more plugins (for example, CATIA 5 or ACIS).

\note If a plugin supports import of materials associated with shapes, these
shapes are grouped corresponding to the imported materials. For the moment STEP
import is the only plugin that supports this feature.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_import_export_page

\section io_import Import file

<em>To import geometrical objects from a BREP, IGES, STEP or STL file:</em>

\par
From the \b File menu choose <b>Import/\<FormatName\></b>, where <b>\<FormatName\></b> is a name
of desirable format. In the <b>Import \<FormatName\></b> dialog box select the file to import
and press \b Open. The file will be imported in the module and its contents (geometrical object)
will be displayed in the <b>Object Browser</b>.

The dialog box to import the file can provide additional parameters.

For example, dialog box for importing files in STL format:

\image html geomimport.png

\par

\note If the selected file is in IGES or STEP format and the model size
is not expressed in meters, the user will be asked whether to take or not the
units into account (see the picture below). This feature can be
helpful if some wrong units have been written to the IGES or STEP file by a
3rd-party software.

\par

\note It is possible to re-open from the initial file a previously imported shape if
the file has been changed on disk. For this, select
<b>Reload From Disk</b> in the context menu of the imported
shape. The reloaded shape will have the same representation parameters
as before this operation.

\section io_export Export file

\n <em>To export geometrical objects into a BREP, IGES, STEP, STL or VTK
file:</em>

\par
Select the object you wish to export, then from the \b File menu choose
<b>Export/\<FormatName\></b>, where <b>\<FormatName\></b> is a name of desirable format.
In the <b>Export \<FormatName\></b> dialog box define the name and the location 
of the file to export and press \b Save.

The dialog box to export the file can provide additional advanced parameters.

For example, dialog box for exporting files in STL format:

\image html geomexport.png

\par

\section io_xao Import and export of shapes in XAO format

XAO is a file format which describes a shape with its topology, groups and fields.

<em>To import a shape in the \b XAO format:</em>

\par
In the \b File menu select <b>Import/XAO</b>.

\image html importxao_dlg.png 

\par

<em>To export a shape in the \b XAO format:</em>

\par
In the \b File menu select <b>Export/XAO</b>.

\image html exportxao_dlg.png 

In this dialog:
- Click the arrow button and select in the Object Browser or in the Viewer the <b>Shape</b> to be exported.
- Input the <b>File name</b> to create a new file or click browse button to save in an existing file.
- Select the \b Groups of the chosen shape to be exported.
- Select the \b Fields of the chosen shape to be exported.
- Press "Apply" or "Apply & Close" button to get the result.

It also possible to export a shape using the TUI Command: <em>geompy.ExportXAO(Shape, FileName, Groups, Fields)</em>
