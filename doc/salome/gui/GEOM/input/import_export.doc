In Geometry module you can import and export geometrical objects
from/into BREP, IGES, STEP files. The mechanisms of import and export
are implemented via plug-ins, which gives the opportunity to
expand the range of available formats by adding more plug-ins (for
example, CATIA 5).

<em>To import geometrical objects from a BREP, IGES, STEP file:</em>

\par
From the \b File menu choose \b Import. In the opening dialog box \b Import
select the required format of the file for importation and search for
a *.brep, *.iges or *.step  file.

\par 
Select the required file and click \b Open. Your file will be imported in
the module and its contents (geometrical object) will be displayed in
the <b>Object Browser</b>.

\note If the selected file is in IGES format and the length is not
expressed in meters, it will be suggested to scale the model into the
metric system (see the picture below). This feature can be helpful if
some wrong units have been written to the IGES file by a
3rd-party software.

\par

\note If the selected file is in ACIS format (the use of this format
requires licensing) and the file contains names for some shapes, it
will be suggested to create groups by types (solid, face, edge and
vertex) for all named shapes:

\note It is possible to re-open from the initial file a previously imported shape if
the file has been changed on disk. For this, select
<b>Reload From Disk</b> in the context menu of the imported
shape. The reloaded shape will have the same representation parameters
as before this operation.

\n <em>To export geometrical objects into a BREP, IGES, STEP
file:</em>

\par
Select the object you wish to export, then from the \b File menu choose
\b Export. In the opening dialog box \b Export define the required format,
the name and the location of the file for exportation.
