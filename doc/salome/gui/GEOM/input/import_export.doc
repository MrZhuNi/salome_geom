In Geometry module you can import and export geometrical objects
from/into BREP, IGES, STEP files. The mechanisms of import and export
are implemented via plug-ins, which gives you the opportunity to
expand the range of available formats by adding more plug-ins (for
example, CATIA 5).

<em>To import geometrical objects from a BREP, IGES, STEP file:</em>

\par
From the \b File menu choose \b Import. In the opening dialog box \b Import
select the required format of the file for importation and search for
a *.brep, *.iges or *.step  file.

the module and its contents (geometrical object) will be displayed in
the <b>Object Browser</b>.

equal to meter following question will be offer to user:

\note If type of selected file is ACIS (optionally - for users with
special license) and this file contains names for some shapes
following question will be offer to user:

\par
If answer is <b>Yes</b> needed groups by types (solid, face, edge and
vertex) for all named shapes will be created.

\note It is possible to re-open from the initial file a previously imported shape if
the file has been changed on disk. For this, select
<b>Reload From Disk</b> in the context menu of the imported
shape. The reloaded shape will have the same representation parameters
as before this operation.
