To generate a \b Path in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Generation - > Restore Path</b>

\image html pipe_path_dlg.png

\n To obtain a \b Path of a pipe-like shape, you should define the
<b>Pipe-like shell or solid</b> and two pipe \b Bases, each of them can
be set as a wire, a face or a list of edges.<br>
\n <b>Select unpublished edges</b> checkbox - if checked, allows
selection of edges in the viewer, that are not published in the Object
Browser.<br>
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge or wire).<br>

\n <b>Advanced options</b>:
<ul>
<li>\ref preview_anchor "Preview"</li>
</ul><br>

\note It is not assumed that exact or approximate copy of the Shape
      can be obtained by applying existing Pipe operation on the
      resulting "Path" wire taking the first Base as the base - it is
      not always possible; though in some particular cases it might
      work it is not guaranteed. Thus, RestorePath function should not
      be considered as an exact reverse operation of the Pipe.<br>

\n <b>Example:</b>

\image html pipe_path.png "Path (red) between two faces (green)"

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.RestorePath(aShape, aBase1, aBase2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 pipe-like shape (shell or solid) + 1
shape (edge, wire or face) for the first base + 1 shape (edge, wire or
face) for the last base.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.RestorePathEdges(aShape, listEdges1, listEdges2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 pipe-like shape (shell or solid) + 1
list of edges for the first base + 1 list of edges for the last base.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of creation of
\ref tui_creation_pipe_path "Complex Geometric Objects".
