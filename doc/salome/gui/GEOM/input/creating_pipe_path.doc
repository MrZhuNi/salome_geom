\page create_pipe_path_page Restore Path

To generate a \b Path in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Generation - > Restore Path</b>

\image html pipe_path_dlg.png

\n To obtain the \b Path of a pipe-like shape, you should define the
<b>Pipe-like shell or solid</b> and two pipe \b Bases, which can
be defined by a wire, a face or a list of edges.<br>
\n <b>Select unpublished edges</b> checkbox - if checked, allows
selecting in the viewer the edges, that are not published in the Object
Browser.<br>
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge or wire).<br>

\n <b>Advanced options</b>:
<ul>
<li>\ref preview_anchor "Preview"</li>
</ul><br>

\note It is not always possible to obtain an exact or approximate
      copy of the Shape by applying the \b Pipe operation to the
      resulting "Path" wire with the first Base as the base;
      though in some particular cases it might
      work. Thus, Restore Path function should not
      be considered as an exact reverse operation of the Pipe.<br>

\n <b>Example:</b>

\image html pipe_path.png "Path (red) between two faces (green)"

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.RestorePath(aShape, aBase1, aBase2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 pipe-like shape (shell or solid) + 1
shape (edge, wire or face) for the first base + 1 shape (edge, wire or
face) for the last base.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.RestorePathEdges(aShape, listEdges1, listEdges2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 pipe-like shape (shell or solid) + 1
list of edges for the first base + 1 list of edges for the last base.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of creation of
\ref tui_creation_pipe_path "Complex Geometric Objects".
