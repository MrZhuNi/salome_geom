This folder contains test scripts for GEOM module.

These tests are exported into the ${GEOM_ROOT_DIR}/bin/test folder and can be executed with the
`salome test` command, as a part of whole testing procedure.

The example Python scripts to be used in the documentation of Geometry module, must be put into the
{root_src}/doc/salome/examples folder!
